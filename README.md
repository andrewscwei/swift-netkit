# NetKit [![CI](https://github.com/andrewscwei/swift-netkit/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/andrewscwei/swift-netkit/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![CD](https://github.com/andrewscwei/swift-netkit/workflows/CD/badge.svg)](https://github.com/andrewscwei/swift-netkit/actions/workflows/cd.yml)

## Setup

```sh
# Install fastlane
$ brew install fastlane
```

## Usage

### Adding NetKit to an Existing Xcode App Project

From Xcode, go to **File** > **Swift Packages** > **Add Package Dependency...**, then enter the Git repo url for NetKit: https://github.com/andrewscwei/swift-netkit.

### Adding NetKit to an Existing Xcode App Project as a Local Dependency

Adding NetKit as a local Swift package allows you to modify its source code as you develop your app, having changes take effect immediately during development without the need to commit changes to Git. You are responsible for documenting any API changes you have made to ensure other projects dependent on NetKit can migrate easily.

1. Add NetKit as a submodule to your Xcode project repo (it is recommended to add it to a directory called `Submodules` in the project root):
   ```sh
   $ git submodule add https://github.com/andrewscwei/swift-netkit Submodules/NetKit
   ```
2. In the Xcode project, drag NetKit (the directory containing its `Package.swift` file) to the project navigator (the left panel). If you've previously created a `Submodules` directory to store NetKit (and possibly other submodules your project may depend on), drag NetKit to the `Submodules` group in the navigator.
   > Once dragged, the icon of the NetKit directory should turn into one resembling a package. If you are unable to expand the NetKit directory from the navigator, it is possible you have NetKit open as a project on Xcode in a separate window. In any case, restarting Xcode should resolve the problem.
3. Add NetKit as a library to your app target:
   1. From project settings, select your target, then go to **Build Phases** > **Link Binary With Libraries**. Click on the `+` button and add the NetKit library.

### Adding NetKit to Another Swift Package as a Dependency

In `Package.swift`, add the following to `dependencies` (for all available versions, see [releases](https://github.com/andrewscwei/swift-netkit/releases)):

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/andrewscwei/swift-netkit.git", from: "<version>")
]
```

## Testing

> Ensure that you have installed all destinations listed in the `Fastfile`. For example, a destination such as `platform=iOS Simulator,OS=18.0,name=iPhone 16 Pro` will require that you have installed the iPhone 16 Pro simulator with iOS 18 in Xcode. In the CI environment, all common simulators should be preinstalled (see [About GitHub Hosted Runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)).

```sh
$ bundle exec fastlane test
```

## Debugging

Internal logging can be enabled by setting the `NETKIT_DEBUG` environment variable:

1. From Xcode > **Edit Scheme...**
2. Go to **Run** > **Arguments** tab
3. Define `NETKIT_DEBUG` under **Environment Variables**, set it to any value or simply leave it blank
